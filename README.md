## Actions

- [x] Bulk selection
- [x] Bulk selection all
- [x] Directory / File preview
- Actions:
    - History
    - `mv`
    - `cp -R`
    - `ln -sf`
    - `rm -rf` && yes-no prompt

## Configuration

edit `fm.awk`, modify the first configuration section:

```awk
    ###################
    #  Configuration  #
    ###################

    OPENER = ( ENVIRON["OSTYPE"] ~ /darwin.*/ ? "open" : "xdg-open" )
    LASTPATH = ( ENVIRON["LASTPATH"] == "" ? ( ENVIRON["HOME"] "/.cache/lastpath" ) : ENVIRON["LASTPATH"] )
    HISTORY = ( ENVIRON["HISTORY"] == "" ? ( ENVIRON["HOME"] "/.cache/history" ) : ENVIRON["HISTORY"] )
    CMDHIST = ( ENVIRON["CMDHIST"] == "" ? ( ENVIRON["HOME"] "/.cache/cmdhist" ) : ENVIRON["CMDHIST"] )
    CACHE = ( ENVIRON["CACHE"] == "" ? ( ENVIRON["HOME"] "/.cache/imagecache" ) : ENVIRON["CACHE"] )
    FIFO_UEBERZUG = ENVIRON["FIFO_UEBERZUG"]
    FMAWK_PREVIEWER = ENVIRON["FMAWK_PREVIEWER"]
    PREVIEW = 0
    RATIO = 0.35
    HIST_MAX = 5000
```

- `OPENER` is the default file opener.
- `LASTPATH` is path which `fm.awk` were last time.
- `HISTORY` is the history for directory visited.
- `CMDHIST` is the command line history, which only the unique command will be left.
- `CACHE` is the cache file path for image file generated by preview.
- `PREVIEW` is a boolean value which toggles preview or not.
- `FIFO_UEBERZUG` and `FMAWK_PREVIEWER` will be automatically set by shell wrapper `fmawk`.
- `PREVIEW` is indicator for review or not, boolean.
- `RATIO` is the ratio for directory / preview.
- `HIST_MAX` is the maximum number of `HISTORY`.

## cmd mode

- `:cd /path/to/destination`
    - can be relative: `:cd ../../` goes to parents two tiers
- `:cmd ` on each selected item.
    - e.g., After selection, `:chmod +x` to give execution permission on selected entries.
- `:cmd {} destination` to replace `{}` with each selected item and execute the whole command.
    - e.g., After selection, `:mv {} ~` will move selected item to `$HOME` directory.
- `:cmd ><` and type tab will leads to Selection mode for directory. After choosing directory by choosing `./`, the `><` part in the command line will be replaced by the directory chosen.
- `cmd` can be shell alias (`bash` and `zsh` confirmed. `fish` not sure).
- tab completion on `:cd ` and search (`/`)
- tab completion on command line mode based on command line history.
- left / right arrow to move cursor; up / down arrow to access command line history.

## TODO

- [x] Image preview (start using ueberzug)
- [x] Make preview script be independent
- [x] Able to redraw by `SIGWINCH`.
- [ ] Make cmd bottom line can be scrollable horizontally even when the string is over the dimension
- [ ] Eliminate action menu by implementing all of those in cmd mode
